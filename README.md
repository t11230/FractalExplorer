FractalExplorer
===============

A project that I made for our fractals class. 

It is written in C++ with [SFML](https://github.com/LaurentGomila/SFML) for a graphics library and two OpenGL shaders for all the heavy lifting.

####Features include:

* Julia set based on point selected from Mandlebrot set
* Zooming on mouse wheel scroll
* Rectangle based zooming
* Pan with middle mouse click
* Dynamically scaling number of iterations
* Logarithm based shading
* Customizable coloring of both sets
* Emulated double precision floating point for deeper zooming


####Todo:

* Saving and loading of the current layout and view
* Additional coloring configurations
* Switch to a real UI toolkit
* Add support for other fractal sets
* 3D fractals support
* Anti-aliasing
* Refactoring and cleanup
